## The Programmer

Hi. I study programming by myself through online resources and am looking for a web development job. I have experience with React (TypeScript, JS, HTML, CSS), Git, Material UI and Firebase, and am studying Node.js and Express.js.

I am always striving to learn about the seemingly endless world of programming, and try to program every day.

## My Other Projects

My most recently completed project _**Meetup Mannaja**_ is something I use with my friends to organise gatherings.
