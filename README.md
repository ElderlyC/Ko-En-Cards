## Introduction

Welcome to our Translation and Flashcard Application! This versatile tool is designed to streamline your language learning journey, offering both translation capabilities and a robust flashcard system to enhance your vocabulary retention.

## Features

### Translation

Easily translate text between Korean and English with our intuitive translation feature. Great for quick translation, or retain your words in the wordlist so you can make flashcards!

### Flashcards

Master new vocabulary and concepts with our customizable flashcard system. Create personalized flashcards with words, phrases, or definitions, and reinforce your learning through spaced repetition. With our flashcard feature, you can organize, review, and track your progress effortlessly.

## Visual Demonstration

At first I used Paint to sketch out my ideas for the various sections of my application. Later Figma helped me understand visually what I wanted to accomplish.
Below are some screenshots from my application in use.

### Subtitle for Screenshots (Home page)

I managed to follow my sketches for the home page almost exactly, except for some minor aesthetic changes. Below is the finished application:

## The Programmer

Hi. I study programming by myself through online resources and am looking for a web development job. I have experience with React (TypeScript, JS, HTML, CSS), Git, Material UI and Firebase, and am studying Node.js and Express.js.

I am always striving to learn about the seemingly endless world of programming, and try to program every day.

## My Other Projects

My most recently completed project _**Meetup Mannaja**_ is something I use with my friends to organise gatherings.
